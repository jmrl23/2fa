Core Functionality (The Essentials)

Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) Generation: This is the primary function. The app uses a shared secret key and the current time to automatically generate a unique, six-to-eight-digit code that is valid for a short period, usually 30 seconds.

Offline Access: The codes are generated locally on the device using a mathematical algorithm based on time and the secret key. No internet or mobile network connection is needed to generate the code.

QR Code Scanning Setup: The most common and easiest way to add a new account is by using the phone's camera to scan a QR code provided by the service (like Google, Facebook, or your bank). This QR code contains the secret key needed to start generating the TOTP.

Multi-Account Support: The ability to store and manage codes for multiple different online services (e.g., email, social media, work VPN) all within a single app.
